  <ul>
    <li>Im a student at "Pinecone" with one of those "<" and ">" (i hope i said the name correctly) and im currently learning web development (🤡🤓).</li>
    <li>My whole intention of becoming a programmer is just because it "fits me" (🤓🤓🤓🤓). You would have known why if you saw me irl.</li>
    <li>Im currently working on like 3 (?) projects at once and they are doing good. atleast i think. (🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓)</li>
    <li>I really like games and thats why around 40% of my projects are game related stuff.</li>
    <li>the rest is either school stuff or useless website that do nothing other than feed my ego. (🤓🤓🤓🤓)</li>
    <li>And if you want to ask me stuff... just dont. im a student with a brain damage after all (this is just a joke, i know some of yall are gonna take it literally. im just meaning that im not good).</li>
    <li>But if you dont care and will aske either ways then mail me i guess. here is the link: reeldob34@gmail.com . and dont get your hopes up cuz i rarely open gamil.</li>
    <li>Im not gonna make a another 🚁 joke and i swear im not ❌ 🏳️‍🌈, please dont kill me. (i censored the words)</li>
