# Hoi there!!1!1 🙃👎 (i know you get this joke)

### Im Sorbi (☝️🤓) if you didnt see the left side of your screen.

here is a run down of some stuff.

- Im a student at <Pinecone> (i hope i said the name correctly) and im currently learning web development (🤡🤓).
- My whole intention of becoming a programmer is just because it "fits me" (🤓🤓🤓🤓). You would have known why if you saw me irl.
- Im currently working on like 3 (?) projects at once and they are doing good. atleast i think. (🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓)
- I really like games and thats why around 40% of my projects are game related stuff.
- the rest is either school stuff or useless website that do nothing other than feed my ego. (🤓🤓🤓🤓)
- And if you want to ask me stuff... just dont. im a student with a brain damage after all (this is just a joke, i know some of yall are gonna take it literally. im just meaning that im not good).
- But if you dont care and will aske either ways then mail me i guess. here is the link: reeldob34@gmail.com . and dont get your hopes up cuz i rarely open gamil.
- Im not gonna make a another 🚁 joke and i swear im not ❌ 🏳️‍🌈, please dont kill me. (i censored the words)
